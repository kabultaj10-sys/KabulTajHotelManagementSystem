   ```

2. **Access the admin panel:**
   - URL: http://localhost:8000/admin/
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin123

   ```

## Production Considerations

2. **Environment**: Update `.env` with production settings
3. **Security**: Change SECRET_KEY and disable DEBUG
4. **Static Files**: Configure proper static file serving
5. **Media Files**: Set up proper media file storage
6. **Redis**: Configure production Redis instance
7. **SSL**: Set up HTTPS for production
